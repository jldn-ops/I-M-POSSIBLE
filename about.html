    <h1>About Jamie DeNovo</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Jamie DeNovo is the creator of the I-M-POSSIBLE® approach, an author and educator who understands what
        it feels like when life does not play fair. Her work grew out of experiences that shattered the usual
        “just try harder” advice and forced her to ask a different question:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What if the problem isn’t that people lack willpower—but that their brains have learned to predict
        disappointment?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of accepting that as the end of the story, Jamie went looking for a way to rebuild belief in
        small, honest steps. That search turned into the I-M-POSSIBLE® books, charts, exercises and programs.

    <h2>Neuroscience Meets Wonderland</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Jamie’s work has been shaped by conversations with leading neuroscientists, including Dr. Bryan Kolb,
        whose research on brain plasticity helped confirm what she sensed from experience: the brain can and does
        change across a lifetime, especially when we are given new patterns to practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, imagination has always been a survival tool for her. The Wonderland themes in her
        writing are not decoration—they are a way of exploring how it feels to be thrown into a world where
        the rules shift and nothing seems fair, and still look for “I-M-POSSIBLE” moves inside that world.

    <h2>The Heart of the Work</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Jamie’s commitment is simple: never ask readers or audiences to do something she has not had to do
        herself. The I-M-POSSIBLE® material is built for people who are already trying, already exhausted, and
        still willing to experiment with one more small shift that might make a real difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through books, I-M-POSSIBLE® Power Posts, coaching and workshops, she offers practical, brain-aware
        ways to move forward without pretending the past didn’t happen.
