  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="section">
    <h1>I-M-POSSIBLE® Book Series &amp; Brain-Building Blueprint</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The I-M-POSSIBLE® Book Series is created for people who have done everything they were told to do
        and still find themselves facing situations that feel impossible. The books introduce a micro-blueprint
        for building your brain, developing a new way of thinking, and reclaiming a measure of control over how
        you respond to what is happening—so you can influence the best possible outcome, even when life feels
        deeply unfair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of offering vague “believe to achieve” slogans, the I-M-POSSIBLE® series walks you through
        specific, brain-based steps for moving from IMPOSSIBLE beliefs to I.M.POSSIBLE beliefs in situations
        that matter most to you.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>The I-M-POSSIBLE® Book Series – Class 16</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Under Class 16, I-M-POSSIBLE® is used in connection with printed books and educational publications,
        including the I-M-POSSIBLE® series shown below.
      </p>

        <h3>Book 1 – I-M-POSSIBLE MUSCLE® for the Mind</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Current cover text: “I.M.POSSIBLE MUSCLE for the MIND”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The flagship book of the series introduces the I-M-POSSIBLE® framework and belief charts. It explains
          how your brain learns “IMPOSSIBLE” from experience, and how to deliberately build an I-M-POSSIBLE®
          Muscle by using small, repeatable mental “reps” in real situations.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Format:</strong> Printed book (Class 16) with integrated write-in sections for reflection and practice.</p>

        <p>
          <em>Current cover text: “Write in This Book”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This companion volume is designed as a write-in workbook that lets you map your own beliefs,
          patterns and I-M-POSSIBLE® tests directly on the page. It turns the ideas from the main book
          into a personal, lived experiment.
        </p>

        <h3>Book 3 – The Wonderland Code (Coming Soon)</h3>
        <p>
          The forthcoming book in the I-M-POSSIBLE® series, <em>The Wonderland Code</em>, continues the
          blend of Wonderland imagination and neuroscience. It explores how to navigate the “rules” of your
          own inner Wonderland when life throws you into a world that does not play fair.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Coming soon as a printed book (Class 16).</p>

  <!-- EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS – CLASS 41 -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>I-M-POSSIBLE® Educational Materials – Class 41</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        In addition to printed books, I-M-POSSIBLE® is also used in connection with educational materials
        and training services under Class 41.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I-M-POSSIBLE® belief-to-outcome charts contrasting IMPOSSIBLE and I.M.POSSIBLE pathways.</li>
        <li>I-M-POSSIBLE® written exercises and “write-in” pages that help readers identify and reframe
            their own thought patterns.</li>
        <li>I-M-POSSIBLE® micro-practice labs—small, real-world experiments that let you test new responses
            safely and track what happens.</li>
        <li>I-M-POSSIBLE® course and workshop content, including concepts such as the “Law of Subtraction”
            and “Mastering the Moment.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These materials are designed for use by individuals, groups and organizations who want practical,
        neuroscience-informed tools for changing outcomes in everyday life.

  <!-- WRITE-IN & PRACTICE -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Write-In Exercises &amp; Practice Labs</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        A core feature of the I-M-POSSIBLE® approach is its emphasis on writing and practice. Many sections
        of <em>I-M-POSSIBLE MUSCLE® for the Mind</em> and the companion write-in book are designed so that
        you are not just reading about change—you are physically mapping your own beliefs, patterns and
        experiments on paper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The books guide you through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifying where your brain currently predicts “IMPOSSIBLE.”</li>
        <li>Designing I.M.POSSIBLE® tests—small, concrete actions you can take in the real world.</li>
        <li>Recording what happens, what you notice, and how your brain responds over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This repeated loop of mapping, experimenting and reflecting is what gradually builds an
        I-M-POSSIBLE® Muscle in the mind.
