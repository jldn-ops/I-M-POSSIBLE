    <h1>The I-M-POSSIBLE Book Series</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The I-M-POSSIBLE books are written for people who are tired of being told to “believe harder” or
        “think positive” while they are living through very real hardship. Each book takes the core idea
        seriously: even when we can’t change what happened, we can still change what our brain expects next.
      </p>
      <p>
        The series blends neuroscience, imagination and practical tools to help you move from IMPOSSIBLE to
        I.M.POSSIBLE, one situation at a time.

        <h2>I.M.POSSIBLE MUSCLE for the MIND</h2>
        <p>
          The flagship book introduces the framework and shows how your brain learns “IMPOSSIBLE”
          from painful experience—and how to begin building an I-M-POSSIBLE Muscle instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through belief charts, stories and practical tools, it gives you a way to work with the brain you
          actually have, not the one motivational slogans assume you have.

        <h2>Write in This Book</h2>
        <p>
          This companion write-in book turns ideas into action. It gives you structured space to map your own
          beliefs, patterns and I-M-POSSIBLE tests directly on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of just reading about change, you’re physically working with your own thoughts, decisions
          and experiments in real situations.

        <h2>The Wonderland Code (Coming Soon)</h2>
        <p>
          The upcoming book <em>The Wonderland Code</em> continues the blend of Wonderland imagination and
          hard neuroscience. It explores how to navigate “rules” that don’t feel fair and how to find new
          I.M.POSSIBLE moves when you feel trapped.

  <!-- PROGRAM SECTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>The Brain-Building Program</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The I-M-POSSIBLE program takes the core ideas from the books and turns them into a step-by-step way
        of living. Instead of a one-time burst of motivation, it focuses on small, repeatable actions that
        gradually change what your brain predicts is possible.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Belief-to-Outcome Maps:</strong> Simple diagrams that show how different thoughts send your
            brain down very different paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Blueprints:</strong> Short, specific tools you can use in real situations when
            everything feels too much.</li>
        <li><strong>Write-In Practices:</strong> Guided pages that help you track what you tried, what happened,
            and what your brain is learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Life Labs:</strong> Practical experiments you can run in your relationships, work and
            daily life to test new patterns safely.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The program can be used on your own through the books, or supported through I-M-POSSIBLE Coaching
        and Workshops.
