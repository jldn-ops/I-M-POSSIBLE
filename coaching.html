      <p>
        I-M-POSSIBLE® coaching is designed for people who are dealing with real-world pressure, exhaustion,
        discouragement, or unfair situations — and still want a way forward that doesn’t require pretending
        things are okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of demanding motivation or belief you don’t have, coaching uses brain-aware principles,
        I-M-POSSIBLE® micro-blueprints, and grounded imaginative tools to help you make realistic shifts
        that your mind can actually work with.
      </p>

  <!-- INDIVIDUAL COACHING -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Individual Coaching</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        One-to-one I-M-POSSIBLE® coaching focuses on your specific situations and how your brain has learned
        to predict them. Together we work on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarifying what feels impossible — and why.</li>
        <li>Understanding the brain’s protective patterns and how they shape expectations.</li>
        <li>Building small, safe I-M-POSSIBLE® tests that move you forward without overwhelm.</li>
        <li>Tracking changes honestly — without toxic positivity or blame.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This work does not require willpower theatrics or “believing in yourself.”  
        It requires curiosity, honesty, and a willingness to test new micro-steps.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>


  <!-- CONSULTING -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Consulting for Organizations</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I-M-POSSIBLE® organizational consulting supports workplaces navigating culture strain, role overload,
        burnout, innovation blocks, or teams who feel discouraged and disconnected.
      </p>
      <p>Consulting engagements may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I-M-POSSIBLE® workshops tailored to your team or sector.</li>
        <li>Culture repair strategies for environments dealing with mistrust or stagnation.</li>
        <li>Neuroplastic “micro-practice” tools to shift team expectations and performance patterns.</li>
        <li>Leadership coaching rooted in grounded, real-world human behavior — not slogans.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Organizational work is always customized and confidential.
