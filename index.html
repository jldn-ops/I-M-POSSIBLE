      <p>
        I-M-POSSIBLE® exists for people who have done everything they were told to do and still find themselves
        facing situations that feel impossible. Instead of forcing you to “think positive” or pretend everything
        is fine, this work meets you where you actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing on neuroscience, lived experience and a touch of Wonderland imagination, the I-M-POSSIBLE®
        approach helps you work with your brain—rather than against it—so you can change what your mind predicts
        about what comes next.

    <h2>Start With the I-M-POSSIBLE® Book Series</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        The books give you a practical way to move from IMPOSSIBLE to I.M.POSSIBLE in situations that matter
        most to you. You are invited to write, think, argue, question and test new ways of responding—on paper
        and in real life.
