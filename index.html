    <h1>What is I-M-POSSIBLE®?</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        I-M-POSSIBLE® is a brain-based framework and way of life that blends neuroscience, imagination and
        practical micro-practices to help people transform “impossible” situations into I.M.Possible outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of demanding that you “think positive” or “believe harder,” I-M-POSSIBLE® shows you how to
        work <em>with</em> the brain you actually have. Using small, repeatable mental shifts and write-in
        exercises, the method helps you change what your brain predicts is possible, one situation at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tools and concepts on this site are drawn from the forthcoming book
        <em>I-M-POSSIBLE MUSCLE® for the Mind</em> and from real conversations with behavioral neuroscience
        pioneer Dr. Bryan Kolb.

    <h2>From IMPOSSIBLE to I.M.POSSIBLE</h2>

      <h3>IMPOSSIBLE Belief-to-Outcome Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Focus: IMPOSSIBLE. Emotional neuro-circuits: depression, stress, helplessness.
        Energy signal: “Give up. Give in. It’s always going to be the same.”
        Brain circuits: inhibition, avoidance, fatigue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a self-fulfilling loop: no practice, no progress, no victories—only stronger disbelief
        and increasing resistance to trying again.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>I.M.POSSIBLE Belief-to-Outcome Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Focus: I.M.POSSIBLE. Emotional neuro-circuits: hope, motivation, determination.
        Energy signal: “Let’s go. There is a way and I’m going to find it.”
        Brain circuits: anticipation, creativity, alertness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Victories—no matter how small—strengthen belief. Stronger belief makes more “impossible” things
        genuinely I.M.POSSIBLE. Over time, the brain begins to treat possibility, not defeat, as its
        default prediction.

    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Belief Charts:</strong> Visual maps that show how different thoughts send your brain
            down very different outcome paths—IMPOSSIBLE vs. I.M.POSSIBLE.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Blueprints:</strong> Small, step-by-step mental “algorithms” that help you test
            new responses in real situations, without pretending everything is fine.</li>
        <li><strong>The Law of Subtraction:</strong> A course concept that focuses on what to remove from
            your mental load so your brain has room to learn something new.</li>
        <li><strong>Mastering the Moment:</strong> Practical tools for doing something useful with the one
            moment you still have power over—this one—when everything feels impossible.</li>
