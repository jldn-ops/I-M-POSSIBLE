    <h1>I-M-POSSIBLE® Speaking &amp; Workshops</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Jamie DeNovo brings the I-M-POSSIBLE® method to audiences through keynotes, interactive talks and
        workshops that blend neuroscience, story and practical tools. Her speaking is designed for real
        people facing real constraints—not for perfect conditions or fairy-tale endings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing from <em>I-M-POSSIBLE MUSCLE® for the Mind</em>, the belief charts and her collaboration
        with Dr. Bryan Kolb, Jamie helps audiences see how their brains are currently predicting defeat,
        and how to begin building an I-M-POSSIBLE® prediction pattern instead.
