      <p>
        I-M-POSSIBLE® Personal Support Services provide structured, non-clinical guidance for people navigating
        difficult life situations, setbacks or transitions. These services use the I-M-POSSIBLE® framework to
        help you hold on to what is real <em>and</em> begin to rebuild a sense of possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus is not on pretending everything is fine. It is on finding small, realistic I-M-POSSIBLE®
        openings in situations where your brain has learned to expect more loss, disappointment or defeat.
