      <p>
        I-M-POSSIBLE® Support Services provide structured, practical guidance for people navigating difficult
        real-life situations. These services are intended for individuals who are seeking clarity, grounding,
        and practical next steps, without clinical or therapeutic treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Support is rooted in the same brain-aware principles used across the I-M-POSSIBLE® books, NEWSCLUB,
        coaching, and speaking engagements: honest language, realistic expectations, and adaptive tools that
        respect what the brain can actually work with during overwhelm.

  <!-- WHAT SUPPORT LOOKS LIKE -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>What I-M-POSSIBLE® Support Can Include</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>Clarifying what feels impossible and narrowing the focus to what <em>is</em> within control.</li>
        <li>Identifying how past experiences shape your brain’s current predictions and reactions.</li>
        <li>Designing gentle, safe I-M-POSSIBLE® micro-tests for real-life situations.</li>
        <li>Using structured reflection to reduce overwhelm and regain direction.</li>
        <li>Support during major discouragement, confusion, decision fatigue, or transition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.75rem; color:#4b5563;">
        These services are non-clinical and for everyday life navigation. They do not replace medical, legal,
        psychological, or crisis-specific assistance.
